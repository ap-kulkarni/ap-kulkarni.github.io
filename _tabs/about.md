Hi, I am Amey Kulkarni, an enthusiast, self taught software professional.
I have around 9 years of experience as a software developer. During this time, I've had the opportunity to work with various programming languages, including Java, Python, Golang, C, and Bash scripting. Additionally, I'm familiar with Perl and JavaScript.

My work has covered a wide range of areas in backend engineering, such as developing REST APIs, transitioning from monolithic to microservices architecture, handling events using Message Queues, creating CLI tools and scripts, building migration tools to transfer data between different product versions, ensuring high availability, and implementing authentication (including protocols like SAML & OIDC) and authorization.

Feel free to get in touch on any socia media handles mentioned in footer.
